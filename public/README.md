# n315-final-project
 A complete CRUD application prototype for the "Jungle Cook" web app. Allows the user to create an account using email and password for authentication through Firebase. Users may browse existing recipes or create their own. Creating their own recipes allows the user to edit/delete those recipes, which are stored in their user profile on the firestore database.

 More specific, detailed descriptions of various functions throughout the site are commented in the app.js file.

 For testing purposes, you may create your own account, or use the following account (which has two recipes already created).
 Email: ft@ft.com
